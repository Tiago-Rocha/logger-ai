# Cross-Platform Logger SDK Overview

This SDK provides a unified logging interface for iOS and Android so host apps can work with a single API surface. It allows apps to log structured events, persist them locally to survive crashes, upload batches automatically in the background, configure delivery constraints through a declarative `LogUploadPolicy`, receive success or failure callbacks, and guarantee idempotent delivery.
