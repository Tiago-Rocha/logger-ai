# Cross-Platform Logger SDK Design Summary

The original one-pager has been split into topic-focused notes under `docs/`:

- [Overview](docs/overview.md)
- [High-Level Architecture](docs/architecture.md)
- [`Logger.log()` Flow](docs/logger-flow.md)
- [`LogUploadPolicy` Model](docs/log-upload-policy.md)
- [Feature Map (MVP â†’ Advanced)](docs/feature-map.md)
- [Cross-Platform Mapping](docs/cross-platform-mapping.md)
- [Interview Talking Points](docs/interview-talking-points.md)

Each document keeps the same content as before, scoped to a single theme so it is easier to reference and maintain.
